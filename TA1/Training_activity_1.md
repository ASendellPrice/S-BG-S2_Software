# S-BG-S2: Training Activity 1

## Details
Use Linux command line and command line tools to:
- Count the number of lines in a file
- Change the content of a file
- Change a file owner and permissions
- Identify the process taking up the most memory
- Check file system disk space usage

## Count the number of lines in a file
To demonstrate counting the number of lines in a file I have created a list of "green" genes from the R142 gene panel [Growth failure in early childhood (Version 3.96)](https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/panels/473/). This gene list can be previewed using the `less` command:

As each line in this file represents a gene, the number of genes can easily be determined by counting the number of lines within the file using the `wc` command. Below I assign the number of lines to the variable "count" which I then use to print the number of lines to the screen using the `echo` command:
